🩺 Diabetes Prediction 

This project focuses on predicting whether a person has diabetes using Machine Learning techniques based on medical attributes.

📌 Problem Statement

Diabetes is a serious and growing health concern worldwide. Early detection can help in timely treatment and prevention of complications. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a person is diabetic based on health-related features.

📊 Dataset

Name: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/saniyashaikh1400/diabetes-prediction

Description:
The dataset contains medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, and blood pressure. The target variable indicates whether a person is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0).

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn

🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm

Logistic Regression

🔑 Key Concepts

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature scaling
Train-test split
Classification modeling
Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

📈 Results

Achieved good classification accuracy using Logistic Regression.
The confusion matrix and classification report were used to evaluate model performance.
The model successfully distinguishes between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
